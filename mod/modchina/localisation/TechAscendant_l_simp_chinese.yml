 tech_rocketry_breakthrough: "突破:无惯性驱动"
## tech_rocketry_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Inertialess Drive ##
 tech_rocketry_breakthrough_desc: "当然，对于每一个力都有一个相等且相反的反作用力。但是，如果一个局部的超空间场可以让我们把多余的惯性排除到子空间中，同时在传输过程中保持一个舒适的1g呢?是的。这是有意义的。花,物理。"
## tech_rocketry_breakthrough_desc -> Sure, for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction. But what if a localized hyperspace field could allow us to expel excess inertia into subspace, while maintaining a comfortable 1 G in transit? Yes. That makes sense. Take that, physics. ##
 tech_particles_breakthrough: "突破:量子力学预测"
## tech_particles_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Predictive Quantum Mechanics ##
 tech_particles_breakthrough_desc: "你不可能同时知道粒子的速度和位置，但如果我们真的很擅长猜测其中一个呢?"

 tech_voidcraft_breakthrough: "突破:星际飞船生活"
## tech_voidcraft_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Living Starships ##
 tech_voidcraft_breakthrough_desc: "飞船将成为其船员的延伸，集成了神经电路、自我保护协议和再生特性。不幸的是，这意味着如果您更改或升级了太多的组件，那么飞船本身可能会提交不舒服的抱怨。官僚主义永远不会结束。"
## tech_voidcraft_breakthrough_desc -> Ships will become extensions of their crew, integrated with neural circuitry, self-preservation protocols, and regenerative properties. Unfortunately, this means that ships themselves may submit discomfort complaints if you change or upgrade their components too much. Bureaucracy never ends. ##
 tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough: "突破:暂时屏蔽"
## tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Temporal Shielding ##
 tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough_desc: "时间是比能量屏障更有效的屏障。小规模的时间位移场将确保攻击无法击中不再存在的东西。"
## tech_field_manipulation_breakthrough_desc -> Time is a far more efficient shield than any energy barrier. Small-scale temporal displacement fields will ensure that attacks cannot hit what is no longer there. ##
 tech_computing_breakthrough: "突破:包含奇点"
## tech_computing_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Contained Singularity ##
 tech_computing_breakthrough_desc: "自我优化的人工智能确实存在比它的创造者更聪明的风险。但我们已经把这个放在一个非常强大的框中，更不用说我们硬编码到它的编程中的3条定律了。我向你保证，一切都很安全。"
## tech_computing_breakthrough_desc -> Self optimizing AI does carry a risk of becoming exponentially more intelligent than its creators. But we have put this one in a very strong box, not to mention the 3 laws we hardcoded into its programming. Everything is perfectly safe, I assure you. ##
 tech_psionics_breakthrough: "突破:灵能历史学
## tech_psionics_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Psychohistory ##
 tech_psionics_breakthrough_desc: "个体是不稳定的，但是群体是可以预测的。结合历史、社会学和统计学，我们可以预测整个帝国的未来。"
## tech_psionics_breakthrough_desc -> Individuals are erratic, but mobs are predictable. Using a combination of history, sociology, and statistics we can predict the future of entire empires. ##
 tech_new_worlds_breakthrough: "突破:最后的边界"
## tech_new_worlds_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: The Final Frontier ##
 tech_new_worlds_breakthrough_desc: "标准化的规划，工厂生产的可部署的住房，以及有效的管理将使边境上的新殖民地得到迅速发展。"
## tech_new_worlds_breakthrough_desc -> Standardized planning, factory produced deployable housing, and efficient management will expediate new colonies on the frontier. ##
 tech_biology_breakthrough: "突破:基因重新编码"
## tech_biology_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Genetic Recoding ##
 tech_biology_breakthrough_desc: "进化是一个强大而缓慢的过程，即使是基因操作也需要一代人的时间才能生效。现在，我们可以实时编辑一个生物体的整个基因组。"
## tech_biology_breakthrough_desc -> Evolution is a powerful but slow process, even genetic manipulation takes a generation to take effect. Now, we can edit the entire genome of a living organism in real time. ##
 tech_statecraft_breakthrough: "突破:通用翻译"
## tech_statecraft_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Universal Translators ##
 tech_statecraft_breakthrough_desc: "语言不仅是不同物种之间的屏障，它还将几乎每个种族内部的不同文化分隔开来。通用翻译器有可能在外交和国内政治上带来革命性的变化。"
## tech_statecraft_breakthrough_desc -> Language is not only a barrier between different species, it separates various cultures within nearly every race. The universal translator has the potential to revolutionize both xeno-diplomacy and internal politics as well. ##
 tech_military_theory_breakthrough: "突破:大战略模拟"
## tech_military_theory_breakthrough -> Breakthrough: Grand Strategy Simulations ##
 tech_military_theory_breakthrough_desc: "通过训练我们的指挥人员从所谓的4X学校计算机模拟，我们的领导人将更好地装备探索，扩大，利用，或消灭需要。"
## tech_military_theory_breakthrough_desc -> By training our command staff with computer simulations from what has become known as the 4X school, our leaders will be better equipped to explore, expand, exploit, or exterminate as needed. ##

 breakthrough.friendly.desc: "我们与 [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] 有良好的关系, 因此，我们可以通过贸易来了解他们的秘密。我们的科学家们已经忙于理论化我们如何将这种新技术应用到我们自己的研究中去。"
## breakthrough.friendly.desc -> We have good relations with the [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural], so in time we may learn their secrets through trade. Our scientists are already busy theorizing how we could adapt this new technology to our own research. ##
 breakthrough.hostile.desc: "这个 [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] 他们不是我们的朋友，他们警惕地守护着他们新发现的技术。我们的间谍们对任何可以让我们为自己揭开这些秘密的信息保持警觉。国务院提倡外交手段，如果我们能重新回到 [spread_origin.GetName], 也许他们会和我们分享他们的创新"
## breakthrough.hostile.desc -> The [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not exactly our friends, and they are guarding their newfound technology vigilantly. Our spies are on alert for any information that may allow us to unlock these secrets for ourselves. The state department advocates a diplomatic approach, if we can get back into the good graces of the [spread_origin.GetName], perhaps they will share their innovations with us. ##
 spread.deteriorated.title: "[spread_origin.GetName] 分类技术秘密"
## spread.deteriorated.title -> [spread_origin.GetName] Classifies their Technological Secrets ##
 spread.deteriorated.desc: "我们的关系与 [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] 已经恶化，他们驱逐了我们的科学家。如果我们想了解他们的技术，我们就必须找到其他方法或修补我们国家之间的裂痕。"
## spread.deteriorated.desc -> Our relationship with the [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] has deteriorated, and they have expelled our scientists from their borders. If we want to understand their technology, we will have to find other means or mend the rift between our nations. ##
 spread.improved.title: "科学无国界"
## spread.improved.title -> Science Knows No Borders ##
 spread.improved.desc: "友谊与日俱增 [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] 人口领先于 [spread_origin.GetName] 打开他们的研究设施 [root.GetSpeciesAdj] 科学家。很快，我们也将从他们先进的技术突破中获益。"
## spread.improved.desc -> The growing friendship with the [spread_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] population has lead the [spread_origin.GetName] to open their research facilities to [root.GetSpeciesAdj] scientists. Soon we too will benefit from their advanced technological breakthroughs. ##
 spread.lost.title: "技术知识流失"
## spread.lost.title -> Technical Knowledge Lost ##
 spread.lost.desc: "我们再也学不到秘密了 [spread_origin.GetName]. 没有边界，它们的进步可能会给科学家们留下一段时间的谜团。"
## spread.lost.desc -> We can no longer learn the secrets of the [spread_origin.GetName]. Either we no longer share a border or they have managed to engineer their technology too enigmatically to emulate. Their advancements are likely to remain mysteries to our scientists for some time. ##

## breakthrough_unity.title -> £unity  [spread_origin.GetName] has made a Breakthrough £unity ##
 
 breakthrough.materials.desc: "他们现在了解先进的工业材料方法。"
## breakthrough.materials.desc -> Nanofabrication has long been a dream of our scientists, but today [materials_origin.GetSpeciesName] researchers have made it a reality. The ability to construct molecules from the ground up, the chance to play with the very building blocks of the universe as if they were Legos, opens entirely new fields for materials technology. The admiralty believes this knowledge would allow for nearly impenetrable hull plating, and it is certain to revolutionize nearly all fields of engineering. ##
 breakthrough.industry.desc: "他们现在了解先进的工程技术。"
## breakthrough.industry.desc -> Silicon lifeforms were once a trope of early [root.GetSpeciesName] science fiction, with novels and television episodes depicting indecipherable rock-like aliens. [industry_origin.GetAdj] scientists have been able to create silicon based life in the flesh... if you can call it flesh. These creatures are essentially living, growing minerals. Instead of mining deep underground for metals and crystals, the raw materials of advanced society can simply be grown. The engineering applications of living minerals are staggering. Some claim it is to be start of a 12th industrial revolution, while others claim that this is the logical conclusion of a long history of resource exploitation, what better end could there be than to find out how to give life to and then exploit the resources themselves. And yes, now you really can have a pet rock. ##
 breakthrough.rocketry.desc: "他们现在了解先进的工业火箭。"
## breakthrough.rocketry.desc -> The biggest limitation of sub-light space travel is not our thrust technology, but our own biology. Ships can handle far greater G-forces than the squishy beings inside them. [rocketry_origin.GetAdj] scientists have shown that a small targeted hyperspace field directly between our engines and the rest of the ship can absorb inertia, effectively reducing any amount of external acceleration to a tolerable interior G force. Apparently there is a small chance that bits of the ship and crew could also leak into hyperspace, but that is a minor price to pay for this kind speed. The test crew did return with 98% of their limbs, which is within the margin of error. This technology will surely revolutionize ship design and have far reaching applications in engineering. ##
 breakthrough.particles.desc: "他们现在了解先进的物理粒子应用。"
## breakthrough.particles.desc -> The uncertainty principle has long fascinated amateur [root.GetSpeciesName] science enthusiasts, who have often misused it to make absurd claims about small furry animals in boxes. [particles_origin.GetAdj] researchers have announced that they can know a particles precise position, and simultaneously have a really really good guess about its speed. Predictive quantum mechanics will completely reshape our understanding of particle physics, with the first of many applications in increasing the output of fusion reactors. A [particles_origin.GetAdj] scientist explained the breakthrough this way: Imagine you have a blorg in a box. You don't know if the blorg is alive or dead, so until you look in the box it is in a state of quantum superposition, the blorg is both alive and dead. But, if we know the blorg is alive, we can guess with near certainty that the blorg wants friends. That is basically how predictive quantum mechanics works. ##
 breakthrough.voidcraft.desc: "他们现在了解先进的太空船模块技术。"
## breakthrough.voidcraft.desc -> Captains have spoken about their ships as if they were living beings since our ancestors were traveling in wooden ships powered by the wind. Today, old superstitions are a reality as [voidcraft_origin.GetAdj] scientists have developed prototypes of organic starships. Made out of a combination of metal and tissue, held together by synaptic circuits, these living voidcraft can sense their surroundings, avoid danger, and heal themselves from superficial injuries. They have hopes and dreams, and make their home among the stars. What new wonders in engineering will these incredible ships bring to our universe? ##
 breakthrough.field_manipulation.desc: "他们现在懂得先进的物理力场理论。"
## breakthrough.field_manipulation.desc -> Shields have always functioned to mitigate damage by placing either a physical or energy based barrier between the attacked and the attacker. [field_manipulation_origin.GetAdj] scientists have found a way to place that barrier not in space, but in time. While true time travel remains out of reach, temporal shielding uses small scale time displacement fields to offset incoming ordinance by a few seconds, preventing it from hitting what it was aimed at. Sadly, time displacement fields are only stable for extremely short periods, so going back in time to tell yourself to make better life choices or what the winning lottery numbers will be remains the stuff of science fiction. Nonetheless, the applications of this technology for physics research are astounding. ##
 breakthrough.computing.desc: "他们现在了解先进的物理计算算法。"
## breakthrough.computing.desc -> The fear that a creation will surpass the capabilities of its creator has been fodder for literature on our world since before we even knew about computing. To this day old stories of monsters being assembled out of parts of the dead or some such nonsense still inspire a cult-like following. However, [computing_origin.GetAdj] scientists have finally done it, creating a self improving intelligence that rapidly made their brightest minds seem like ants in comparison to the new singularity. Conveniently, [computing_origin.GetAdj] researchers also put that super-intelligence inside an unstable hyperspace field which they can shut down at any moment. Critics say such an all powerful being cannot be contained forever, and that eventually the intelligence will simply talk the scientists into releasing it. But such an idea is absurd, why would anyone in their right mind let a likely angry and malevolent super-intelligence out of its box? Well, until such time as it does escape, the researchers are rapidly expanding their knowledge of physics and finding new avenues of research in all fields by learning from the being. ##
 breakthrough.psionics.desc: "他们现在明白了先进的灵能理论"
## breakthrough.psionics.desc -> Predicting the future has long been relegated to the fringes of our society, with soothsayers and fortune tellers merely telling tales that their audience already wants to hear. However, while the future of an individual is chaotic and unpredictable, the behavior of large groups, planets, and entire empires is quite knowable, just as the path of a single molecule in a gas is chaos, we can nonetheless predict the behavior the gas as a group as it fills a container despite knowing little about the individual molecules within. [psionics_origin.GetAdj] researchers have shown that through a combination of statistics, sociology, and history they can apply this to the galaxy at large, and the larger the group, the more accurate the future they can predict. Their newfound uncanny ability to predict the future is leading to advances in all fields, and unifying their people as never before. Perhaps this is all a great act however, a few deranged [psionics_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have broken free and claimed that they foresee impending doom for the entire galaxy. They have started some sort of 'Foundation' to preserve knowledge through a thousand years of darkness. They are clearly lunatics to be ignored. ##
 breakthrough.new_worlds.desc: "他们现在了解先进的新世界扩张学。"
## breakthrough.new_worlds.desc -> New colonies were once a wild lawless land, full of foolhardy but well meaning characters and a sense of adventure. While a romantic notion popular in books and holovids, this was never a highly efficient system for spreading to new worlds. [new_worlds_origin.GetAdj] researchers have streamlined colony protocols and tamed the frontier with the stroke of a pen and some orderly ordinances. New [new_worlds_origin.GetSpeciesName] colonies will develop at a faster rate and secure larger, self sufficient populations with ease. Each new colony can be seen as an incubator for new social structures, a vast social experiment that could revolutionize [new_worlds_origin.GetSpeciesAdj] society. ##
 breakthrough.biology.desc: "他们现在了解先进的社会生物学。"
## breakthrough.biology.desc -> Genetics manipulation was once considered an ethical dilemma by early [root.GetSpeciesName] society. It would be too easy to create a permanent underclass of the genetically inferior, and conflict with genetically enhanced super-[root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] was a common trope of period science fiction. However, [biology_origin.GetAdj] scientists have discovered a way to make instant edits directly to living subjects, revolutionizing genetics, biology, and their society at large. Now evolution does not have to wait for generations to have an effect, and societal stratification is a not a concern as anyone anytime could alter their genome as they see fit. Somehow, this is not exactly a comforting thought. ##
 breakthrough.statecraft.desc: "他们现在懂得了先进的社会习俗。"
## breakthrough.statecraft.desc -> In early [root.GetSpeciesAdj] science fiction, universal translators were little more than a plot device, language barriers were inconvenient to the flow of most 30 minute episodes. Yet today, [statecraft_origin.GetAdj] researchers have developed a real life portable device that can allow natural communication between anyone. With the idealistic belief that simple communication could be the last, best hope for peace, [statecraft_origin.GetName] has built a station in neutral territory to prevent future wars, a place where [statecraft_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. Its a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. The name of the place is Babylon 5. Perhaps we should send an ambassador. ##
 breakthrough.military_theory.desc: "他们现在了解先进的社会军事理论。"
## breakthrough.military_theory.desc -> The lessons of history are the keys to the future. It seems that nearly every [military_theory_origin.GetSpeciesName] on [military_theory_origin.GetHomeWorldName] has become obsessed with a series of grand strategy games that depict various time periods from their history. Some cover the great wars of their past, the struggles of feudal lords to gain power when [military_theory_origin.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were still a primitive race, or more recent events like exploration and expansion into space. It seems that this fascination with history and strategy has cultivated a crop of leaders far better equipped to understand complex situations and deal with tactics and logistics to lead large fleets into battle. ##
