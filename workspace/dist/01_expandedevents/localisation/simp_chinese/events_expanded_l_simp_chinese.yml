distar.65.akx.c:0 "过去是什么，将来会是什么。他们的命运不由我们掌握。"
## distar.65.akx.c -> What was, shall be. Their fate is out of our hands. ##
distar.185.mi.desc:0 "科学家[Root.GetLeaderName]在[From.GetName]上有一些令人不安的发现。这个星球上的巨型懒虫不仅分布广泛而且数量庞大，而且是掠食性的。各种各样的食肉植物在它的表面耐心地休息，释放芳香的诱惑到空气中，等待猎物靠近。植物叶子末端的敏感卷须记录了动物接近的过程，导致植物在它们不幸的猎物周围突然闭合，这些猎物会被消化酸慢慢腐蚀。"
## distar.185.mi.desc -> Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has made some troubling finds on [From.GetName]. The planet's megaflora is not only widespread and gargantuan in proportion, but also predatory. Various species of carnivorous plants rest patiently on its surface, releasing aromatic lures into the air and waiting for prey to come near. Sensitive tendrils on the terminus of the plant's leaves register the approach of animals, resulting in the plants snapping shut around their hapless prey, which are left to be slowly corroded by digestive acids. ##
distar.3001.gc.desc:0 "事实证明，谨慎是合理的。隐藏在[trojan_asteroid.GetName]内部的是一群老旧的采矿单位，它们被编程用来攻击目标。\n\n幸运的是，自主科学单位[Root.GetLeaderName]很早就发现了这一点，并能够长时间干扰单位的传感器，使其失效。\n\n单位的核心确实是旧的，但仍保留着大量的能量用于虹吸。"
## distar.3001.gc.desc -> Caution proved well in order. Hidden inside [trojan_asteroid.GetName] was a host of old mining drones programmed to attack on sight.\n\nAutonomous Science Drone [Root.GetLeaderName] fortunately detected this early and was able to jam the drones' sensors long enough to disable them.\n\nThe drones' cores are old indeed, but retain vast amounts of energy for siphoning. ##
distar.3003.gc.desc:0 "有关小行星[trojan_asteroid.GetName]的事件引起了我们[Root.Capital.GetName]中央处理网络的注意。我们的单位引起了人们的好奇，提出了一些问题，比如为什么这些单位最初被放置在小行星内部。\n\n他们在守卫什么吗?"
## distar.3003.gc.desc -> The events relating to asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] has attracted the attention of our central processing network on [Root.Capital.GetName]. Our research drones has reacted with curiosity, posing questions as to why the drones were originally placed inside the asteroid.\n\nWere they guarding something? ##
distar.3005.gc.desc:0 "正如我们的研究网络所假设的那样，在小行星[trojan_asteroid.GetName]中发现的单位确实隐藏了一些东西。\n\n[Root.GetName]成员的英勇努力在这颗小行星的核心发现了丰富的矿藏，此前这些矿藏被单位的存在所掩盖。"
## distar.3005.gc.desc -> As our research network hypothesized, the drones found in asteroid [trojan_asteroid.GetName] were indeed hiding something.\n\nThe valiant efforts of the [Root.GetName]'s crew have unearthed rich mineral deposits in the asteroid's core, previously obscured by the drones' presence. ##

anomalymod.1.name:0 "逐步恢复的坟墓星球"
## anomalymod.1.name -> Recovered Tomb World ##
anomalymod.1.desc:0 "这些不寻常的辐射区似乎是古代核轰炸的结果，那次核轰炸摧毁了[From.GetName]的原始种群。数万年前，[From.GetName]几乎是一个不适合人类居住的坟墓世界。然而，在随后的千年里，辐射已经下降到名义水平，使星球的生态系统得以恢复。"
## anomalymod.1.desc -> The unusual radiation pockets appears to be the result of an ancient nuclear bombardment that wiped out [From.GetName]'s original population. Tens of thousands of years ago, [From.GetName] would have been a near-uninhabitable tomb world. In the intervening  millennium, however, the radiation has receded to nominal levels, allowing the planet's ecosystem to recover. ##
anomalymod.2.name:0 "封闭的虫洞"
## anomalymod.2.name -> Closed Wormhole ##
anomalymod.2.desc:0 "[From.GetName]的异常读数似乎与自然发生的虫洞的类似读数一致。科学家[Root.GetLeaderName]推测[From.GetName]曾经是一个虫洞，但是由于未知的原因，通往另一边的通道被切断了。如果这是真的，研究[From.GetName]可以大大提高我们对虫洞物理的理解。"
## anomalymod.2.desc -> The unusual readings of [From.GetName] appear to be consistent with similar readings of naturally occuring wormholes. Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has theorized that [From.GetName] was once a wormhole, but the passage to the other side has since pinched off for unknown reasons. If true, studying [From.GetName] could greatly enhance our understanding of wormhole physics. ##
anomalymod.3.name:0 "黑洞合并"
## anomalymod.3.name -> Black Hole Merger ##
anomalymod.3.desc:0 "[From.GetName]星系中的黑洞实际上是两个黑洞在过去几千年的某个时候合并在一起，这是一个能量如此巨大的事件，以至于我们今天仍然可以感受到引力的回声。"
## anomalymod.3.desc -> The black hole in the [From.GetName] system is in fact two black holes that have merged together some time in the last few thousand years, an event so energetic that it's gravitational echos can still be felt today. ##
anomalymod.4.name:0 "发现暗物质"
## anomalymod.4.name -> Dark Matter Discovered ##
anomalymod.4.desc:0 "不同寻常的引力读数[From.GetName]一直追溯到§H暗物质§!的丰富来源。这种奇特的物质似乎违背了几个已知的物理定律，导致了[Root.GetName]测量的异常读数。"
## anomalymod.4.desc -> The unusual gravitational readings of [From.GetName] have been traced back to an abundant source of §HDark Matter§!. This exotic substance seemingly defies several known laws of physics, leading to the unusual readings measured by the [Root.GetName]. ##
anomalymod.5.name:0 "机器人矿工"
## anomalymod.5.name -> Robot Miners ##
anomalymod.5.desc:0 "对[From.GetName]的进一步扫描显示，这些废弃建筑是大规模废弃采矿作业的一部分。有趣的是，工厂完全由高度专业化的机器人工人操作。这台机器已经停止运转，但它的状况良好，理论上可以重新启动。"
## anomalymod.5.desc -> Closer scans of [From.GetName] revealed that the abandoned structures were part of a massive abandoned mining operation. Interestingly, the facility was operated entirely by heavily specialized robotic workers. The machinery is no longer operating, but it is in good enough condition that the facility could theoretically be turned back on. ##
anomalymod.5.a:0 "把它拆开，研究这项技术"
## anomalymod.5.a -> Tear it apart and study the technology ##
anomalymod.5.b:0 "给设施供电"
## anomalymod.5.b -> Power on the facility ##

## anomalymod.6.name -> Mineral Processing ##
anomalymod.6.desc:0 "[From.GetName]上废弃的建筑是一座古代精炼厂的遗迹。从长期塌陷的矿井中开采出来的材料在这里被加工成有用的矿物。矿脉似乎早已枯竭，但我们仍可研究该设施本身的技术。"
## anomalymod.6.desc -> The derelict structures on [From.GetName] are the remnants of an ancient mineral refinery. Materials brought up from long-collapsed mines were processed here into useful minerals. The mineral veins appear to have been exhausted long ago, but we can still study the technology of the facility itself. ##
anomalymod.7.name:0 "发现稀有矿石"
## anomalymod.7.name -> Rare Ores Discovered ##
anomalymod.7.desc:0 "[From.GetName]上的废弃构造是一个长期废弃的稀有矿物矿山的遗迹。有趣的是，扫描结果显示，这些矿藏中仍然充满了这些稀有的矿石，等待着被挖掘出来。为什么矿山废弃仍然未知。"
## anomalymod.7.desc -> The derelict structures on [From.GetName] are the remnants of a long abandoned mine of rare minerals. Interestingly, scans indicate that the mines are still full of these rare ores, just waiting to be dug up. Why the mines were abandoned remains unknown. ##
anomalymod.8.name:0 "友好的野生动物"
## anomalymod.8.name -> Friendly Wildlife ##
anomalymod.8.desc:0 "对[From.GetName]野生动物的调查显示，这个星球曾经是一个小型爬行动物种族的殖民地。这个现已灭绝的文明系统地改造了当地的野生动物，使它们对脆弱的生物更加友好，而我们今天看到的温顺的野生动物是一个大规模基因工程项目的后代。"
## anomalymod.8.desc -> Investigations into [From.GetName]'s wildlife revealed that the planet was once a colony of a race of small reptilians. This now extinct civilization had systematically engineered the native wildlife to be more hospitable to their fragile biology, and the docile wildlife we see today are the descendants of a massive genetic engineering program. ##
anomalymod.9.name:0 "菌根真菌"
## anomalymod.9.name -> Mycorrhiza Fungus ##
anomalymod.9.desc:0 "[From.GetName]的土壤是大量菌根真菌的宿主，它们与星球上的植物共生。这种真菌能够非常有效地从土壤中提取营养物质，使植物在正常情况下无法生长。"
## anomalymod.9.desc -> The soil of [From.GetName] is host to an abundant mycorrhiza fungus living symbiotically with the planet's plant life. This fungus is extremely efficient at extracting nuitrients from the soil, allowing plant life to thrive beyond what would normally be expected. ##
anomalymod.10.name:0 "钙化蠕虫"
## anomalymod.10.name -> Calcified Worms ##
anomalymod.10.desc:0 "在营养物质方面，[From.GetName]的土壤条件异常贫瘠，星球上有些地区的土壤非常贫瘠，根本无法生长。其原因可以追溯到一种现已灭绝的环节动物，它们曾经生活在[From.GetName]上。这些巨大的蠕虫状生物在死亡时趋向于钙化，将营养物质困在它们石质的尸体中。这就导致了我们今天所看到的贫瘠的土壤条件，并不可避免地导致了它们自身的灭绝。"
## anomalymod.10.desc -> Soil conditions on [From.GetName] are unusually poor in nuitrients, with some areas of the planet so deficient that nothing can grow at all. The cause can be traced back to a now extinct class of annelids that once lived on [From.GetName]. These large worm-like creatures tended to calcify on death, trapping nuitrients in their stony corpses. This lead to the poor soil conditions we see today, and inevitably causing their own extinction. ##
anomalymod.11.name:0 "大量的蠕虫"
## anomalymod.11.name -> Massive Worms ##
anomalymod.11.desc:0 "[From.GetName]是生活在星球土壤深处的大型蠕虫的家园。虽然这些蠕虫的传播可能会破坏星球表面的生命，但它们留下的隧道为星球上的矿藏提供了便捷的通道。"
## anomalymod.11.desc -> [From.GetName] is home to massive worms living deep in the planet's soil. While the passage of these worms can be disruptive to life on the surface, the tunnels they leave behind provide easy access to the planet's mineral deposits. ##
anomalymod.12.name:0 "皮萨兰月球"
## anomalymod.12.name -> Pitharan Moon ##
anomalymod.12.desc:0 "奇怪的是，[From.GetName]上异常丰富的土壤可以追溯到月球[pitharan_moon.GetName]上的尘埃。[pitharan_moon.GetName]的外壳中含有大量的皮萨兰尘埃，这是一种非常有效的肥料。这些尘埃会周期性地被陨石撞击而喷射出来，并最终到达[From.GetName]。"
## anomalymod.12.desc -> The unusually rich soil on [From.GetName] has, strangely enough, been traced back to dust from the planet's moon, [pitharan_moon.GetName]. [pitharan_moon.GetName] contains massive deposits of Pitharan Dust, a highly potent fertilizer, within in its crust. This dust will periodically be ejected by meteorite impacts and find its way to [From.GetName]. ##
anomalymod.13.name:0 "一颗奇特的恒星"
## anomalymod.13.name -> A Peculiar Star ##
anomalymod.13.desc:0 "科学家[przybylski_star_leader.GetName]认为[przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHe]已经解开了[From.GetName]的谜团。[przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHeCap]将这颗恒星确定为Ap级恒星，已知其铁元素含量较低，重元素含量高于普通恒星。然而，更详细的分析显示，[From.GetName]含有许多短寿元素，如钚和锕，它们早就应该衰变成较轻的元素。\n\n我们的科学家一直在努力解释[From.GetName]的发现，他们提出了各种假设，从未被发现的甚至更重的元素的存在，到外星文明的污染。科学家[przybylski_star_leader.GetName]已经准备了一个特殊的项目来测试已经提出的许多假设。"
## anomalymod.13.desc -> Science Officer [przybylski_star_leader.GetName] thought that [przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHe] had solved the mystery of [From.GetName]. [przybylski_star_leader.GetSheHeCap] had identified the star as an Ap class star, which is known to be lower in iron and higher in heavier elements than typical stars. However, more detailed analysis revealed that [From.GetName] contains many short lived elements, such plutonium and actinium, which should have decayed into lighter elements long ago.\n\nOur scientists have struggled to explain the findings from [From.GetName], with hypotheses ranging from the presence of undiscovered, even heavier elements, to contamination by an alien civilization. Science Officer [przybylski_star_leader.GetName] has prepared a special project to test the many hypotheses that have been put forth. ##
anomalymod.14.desc:0 "科学家[Root.GetLeaderName]发现在[From.From.GetName]中发现的锕系元素实际上是非常稳定的同位素。[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]的科学家长期以来一直假设存在稳定的重同位素，被称为“稳定岛”，但在自然界中从未观测到这种同位素。\n\n这一发现的消息在科学界引起了轩然大波，并有望彻底改变我们对物理学的理解。"
## anomalymod.14.desc -> Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has discovered that the actinide elements found in [From.From.GetName] are in fact remarkably stable isotopes. [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] scientists have long hypothesized the existance of stable heavy isotopes, known as the 'Island of Stability,' but never before have such isotopes been observed in nature.\n\nNews of the discovery has sent shockwaves through our scientific community, and is expected to revolutionize our understanding of physics. ##
anomalymod.14.a.tooltip:1 "[From.From.GetName]:\n£physics  §G+9§!"
## anomalymod.14.a.tooltip -> [From.From.GetName]:\n£physics  §G+9§! ##
anomalymod.15.name:0 "解剖萌新"
## anomalymod.15.name -> Dissected Gateway ##
anomalymod.15.desc:0 "[From.GetName]上面散落的残骸实际上是一个星门的残余物，这个星门是被蓄意和系统地拆除的，显然是为了了解它是如何运作的。虽然这一通道无法修复，但通过在[From.GetName]上方建立轨道研究设施，我们可以清楚地了解其内部工作情况。"
## anomalymod.15.desc -> The scattered remains above [From.GetName] are in fact remnants of a gateway that was deliberately and systematically dismantled, apparently in an attempt to learn how it functions. While the gateway is beyond all hope of repair, by establishing an orbital research facility above [From.GetName] we can get a clear picture of its inner working. ##
anomalymod.16.name:0 "巨大的珍珠"
## anomalymod.16.name -> Giant Pearls ##
anomalymod.16.desc:0 "[From.GetName] 的海洋是几种大型蓬勃发展的带壳软体生物的家园。这些物种产生一种彩虹色的凝结物，就像珍珠形成的机制一样，这些外星珍珠具有艳丽的色彩和很大的体积，最大的样本直径达到半米。 如果我们在[From.GetName]上建立一个殖民地，我们可以进一步研究这些生物，以便进一步发掘其经济价值。"
## anomalymod.16.desc -> The oceans of [From.GetName] is home to several large and thriving species of shelled mollusks. These species produce iridescent stones, like some similar known lifeforms, but the pearls they produce are of an unprecedented size and quality, the largest found being almost half a meter across. If we establish a colony on [From.GetName], we could setup a pearl-harvesting operation with minimal effort. ##

anomalymod.22.name:0 "[lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName]友好的太空变形虫"
## anomalymod.22.name -> [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] the Friendly Space Amoeba ##
anomalymod.22.desc:0 "为什么[lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName]的野生亲属如此好斗，而它却如此友善，这一直是个谜，但今天我们的科学家已经取得了突破。我们的一位科学家注意到，当[lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName]接近测试新型推进器原型的舰船时，她变得异常愤怒。这名官员意识到阿米巴变形虫对船上排气中的某些化学物质很敏感。即使是我们标准舰船的废气也含有刺激物，尽管[lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName]似乎已经对它们产生了耐受性。对这一现象的进一步研究可能会揭示一种安抚野生空间变形虫的方法。"
## anomalymod.22.desc -> It has long been a mystery why [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] is so friendly when her wild kin are so aggressive, but today our scientists have been able to make a breakthrough. One of our science officers noticed that [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] became unusually irritated when she came close to some ships testing out new prototype thrusters. The officer came to realize that the amoeba is sensitive to certain chemical's in the ship's exhaust. Even the exhaust of our standard ships contains irritants, although [lost_amoeba_fleet.GetName] appears to have developed a tolerance for them. Further investigation into this phenomena might reveal a way to pacify wild space amoebas. ##
anomalymod.22.a:0 "一个有前途的发现。继续调查。"
## anomalymod.22.a -> A promising discovery. Continue investigating. ##

anomalymod.41.name:0 "脑蛞蝓再次出现"
## anomalymod.41.name -> Brainslugs Revisited ##
anomalymod.41.desc:0 "当[Root.GetName]第一次发现脑蛞蝓时，我们坚决拒绝了他们的结合提议。他们存在的所有证据都被掩盖了，他们成为了国家机密，只有政府的最高层才知道。但这些过去的领导人没有经历过像[Root.GetRulerTitle][Root.GetRulerName]那样与脑蛞蝓的结合。联邦不是什么可怕的东西，我们的人民应该有机会为自己做出这个决定，而不是由一个可怕的政府为他们做出决定。"
## anomalymod.41.desc -> When the [Root.GetName] first discovered the brain slugs, we firmly rejected their offer of union. All evidence of their existance were covered up, and they became a state secret, known only to the highest levels of government. But those leaders of the past had not experience union with the brain slugs, like [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] has. Union is not something to be feared, and our people deserve a chance to make this decision for themselves, not made for them by a fearful government. ##

anomalymod.61.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: 敬拜死去的神"
## anomalymod.61.name -> [the_planet.GetName]: Worship of the Dead God ##
anomalymod.61.desc:0 "我们在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!的观察哨注意到当地宗教之间有一种不同寻常的相似之处。\n\n当地人似乎已经把这个巨大的生物的遗体当作死亡之神崇拜了好几代，而且已经不记得了。当地人相信有一天他们的神会从死里复活，变成重生的神，为他们的人民带来一个繁荣的新时代。"
## anomalymod.61.desc -> Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed an unusual similarity in the local religions.\n\nIt seems that the locals have worshiped the remains of the gargantuan creature on the planet's moon as a god of death for generations beyond their remembrance. The locals believed that one day their god would rise from the dead, transforming into a deity of rebirth and ushering in a new era of prosperity for their people. ##
anomalymod.63.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: 灵能发展"
## anomalymod.63.name -> [the_planet.GetName]: Developing Psionics ##
anomalymod.63.desc:0 "我们在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!的观察哨站注意到一个不寻常的发展。\n\n[the_planet.GetName]的当地居民最近开始发展潜在的灵能。我们的研究人员仍不确定原因，但这一进展似乎与死亡的外星生物在月球上释放的精神药物增多同时发生。\n\n当地人自己似乎也把这种新发现的能力归因于他们的死神赐予信徒的恩惠。这种几乎普遍的信仰对他们的文化发展产生了重大影响。"
## anomalymod.63.desc -> Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has noticed an unusual development.\n\nThe local populations of [the_planet.GetName] have recently begun to develop latent psionic powers. Our researchers are still unsure of the cause, but the development seems to have coincided with an increase in psychotropic chemicals released by the dead alien creature on the planet's moon.\n\nThe locals themselves appear to have attributed their newfound abilities as a boon granted to the faithful by their god of death. This almost universal belief has significantly impacted their cultural development. ##
anomalymod.65.name:0 "[the_planet.GetName]: 超越"
## anomalymod.65.name -> [the_planet.GetName]: Transcendence ##
anomalymod.65.desc:0 "我们在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!的观察哨站报告说，当地居民似乎在一夜之间就完全觉醒了，这让我们的科学家困惑于这样的事件怎么会发生得如此之快。[the_planet.GetName]的当地人已经完全接受了他们的新力量，相信这是他们的死神即将重生的标志。"
## anomalymod.65.desc -> Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported a full psionic awakening among the local population seemingly overnight, leaving our scientists puzzled at how such an event could occur so quickly. The natives of [the_planet.GetName] have fully embraced their new powers, believing this to be a sign that their god of death will soon be reborn. ##

## anomalymod.67.name -> [the_planet.GetName]: Moon Landing ##
anomalymod.67.default.desc:0 "我们在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!的观察哨报告说，当地人成功地完成了载人登月任务。他们选择了外星人的尸体作为登陆地点，这对当地人来说具有重要的文化意义。这次任务取得了巨大的成功，宇航员们安全返回了他们的家园。"
## anomalymod.67.default.desc -> Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to seend a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. The mission was an unmitigated success, and the astronauts have made it safely back to their homeworld. ##
anomalymod.67.psionic.desc:0 "我们在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!的观察哨报告说，当地人成功地完成了载人登月任务。他们选择了外星人的尸体作为登陆地点，这对当地人来说具有重要的文化意义。奇怪的是，当他们到达那具尸体时，出现了一道闪光，宇航员们消失了好几个小时。在返回他们的家园后，有报道称月球探险者表达了之前未开发的灵能，当地人认为这是他们的死神赐予的礼物。"
## anomalymod.67.psionic.desc -> Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to seend a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. Strangely, when they arrived at the corpse, there was a flash of light, upon which the astronauts disappeared for several hours. Upon returning to their homeworld, there have been reports of the lunar explorers expressing previously undeveloped psionic powers, which the locals attribute as a gift from their god of death. ##
anomalymod.67.materialist.desc:0 "我们在§Y[the_planet.GetName]§!报道说，当地居民已经成功地向月球发射了载人任务。他们选择了外星人的尸体作为登陆地点，这对当地人来说具有重要的文化意义。在检查尸体时，我们震惊地发现尸体实际上只是一个死去的外星人，而不是他们所相信的死神。\n\n关于宇航员的发现的报道已经传遍了[the_planet.GetName]。虽然有些人已经接受了这些发现，但许多人否认，有些人甚至声称整个登月计划是一场精心策划的骗局。"
## anomalymod.67.materialist.desc -> Our observation outpost over §Y[the_planet.GetName]§! has reported that the natives have managed to send a manned mission to their moon. They chose as their landing site the corpse of the dead alien creature, which has great cultural significance to the locals. Upon inspecting the corpse, they we shocked to discover that corpse was indeed just a dead alien, and not the god of death that they had believed it to be.\n\nReports of the astronauts' discovery have already spread across [the_planet.GetName]. While some have come to accept these findings, many are in denial, some going as far as to claim that the entire lunar program was an elaborate hoax. ##
anomalymod.68.name:0 "愤怒的神"
## anomalymod.68.name -> Angry Gods ##
anomalymod.68.desc:0 "有报道称，[Root.GetName]造成的神秘伤害和死亡数量惊人。这些事件之间几乎没有什么联系，除了它们往往发生在土著居民附近。由于他们对最近的不幸事件具有可疑的免疫力，地方当局已将他们列为可能的罪犯。"
## anomalymod.68.desc -> There have been reports of an alarming number of mysterious injuries and death on [Root.GetName]. There is little that connects these events, except that they tend to occur most frequently near the native population. Due to their suspicious immunity to the recent misfortunes, the local authorities have fingered them as the likely culprits. ##

## anomalymod.69.desc -> Further reports from [Root.GetName].\n\nThe native population has undergone sudden and unexpected psionic awakening, seemingly overnight. Our scientists are at a loss to explain this sudden phenomena. The natives themselves have attributed their new powers as a boon from their god of death, to aid them in overthrowing thier oppressors - that is to say, us. ##

As one of the crew discovered to their misfortune, the Gas Bags tend to explode violently when their sacks are ruptured, which is enough to discourage predation.

## colonyexpanded.1.b -> They can hunt their own beasts. ##
colonyexpanded.2.desc:0 "我们的军队已经完成了他们的任务，拖着一具巨大的、没有毛发的、有着锋利爪子和牙齿的哺乳动物的尸体。他们在一个地下定居点附近遇到了一群生物，在那里，他们设法杀死了一些生物，并把其余的动物赶回隧道深处。后来，他们和当地人一起封锁隧道，防止进一步的入侵。他们带回了其中一种生物的尸体供研究。"
## colonyexpanded.2.desc -> Our armies have come back from their mission, hauling the corpse of a massive, hairless mammalian creature with sharp claws and teeth. They encountered a group of creatures near one of the underground settlements, where they managed to kill several of the creatures, and drive back the rest deeper into the tunnels. Afterwards, they worked with the natives to seal off the tunnels to prevent further incursions. They have brought back the corpse of one of the creatures for study. ##
colonyexpanded.2.a:0 "干得好!"
## colonyexpanded.2.a -> Good work! ##
colonyexpanded.3.desc:0 "[Root.GetName]上发生了一系列地震，随后出现了数百种大型爪类动物。似乎由于我们的不作为，这些生物突破了一个地下定居点的防御，然后爬上了地面。最初的裂口周围的区域已经被疏散和隔离，在这些生物得到处理之前，不能再有人居住。"
## colonyexpanded.3.desc -> There was a series of earthquakes on [Root.GetName], followed by the emergence of several hundred massive clawed creatures. It appears that due to our inaction, these creatures overwhelmed the defenses of one of the subterranean settlements, and then clawed their way to the surface. The area around the initial breach has been evacuated and quarantined, and cannot be populated again until these creatures are dealt with. ##
colonyexpanded.10.name:0 "要求机器人技术"
## colonyexpanded.10.name -> Request for Robotic Technology ##
colonyexpanded.10.desc:0 "在看到我们先进的机器人技术后，一个来自地下外星帝国[Root.GetName]的代表团已经抵达，他们要求用大量的矿物来交换我们的一些机器人。\n\n我们的一些军官不愿意同意这一要求，担心他们可能会将机器人用于军事用途。然而，如果我们拒绝这个要求，外星人肯定会认为这是一种侮辱。"
## colonyexpanded.10.desc -> Having seeing our advanced robotic technology, a delegation from the subterranean alien empire on [Root.GetName] has arrived asking to trade a substantial amount of minerals for the use of some of our robots.\n\nSome of our military officers are reluctant to agree to the request, fearing that they might be able to repurpose the robots for military use. If we refuse the request, however, the aliens are certain to view it as an insult. ##
colonyexpanded.10.a:0 "把机器人交给原始人似乎不是个好主意。"

## colonyexpanded.11.desc -> A delegation from the subterranean alien empire on [Root.GetName] has arrived petitioning us to allow a group of their engineers to tour and study our engineering and mineral production facilities. Allowing them onto the surface will temporarily reduce production on the planet as our facilities work to accommodate them, but refusing might hurt our relations. ##
colonyexpanded.11.a:0 "我们的设备太忙，容纳不了他们。"
## colonyexpanded.11.a -> Our facilities are too busy to accommodate them. ##
colonyexpanded.11.b:0 "允许他们参观我们的设施。"

colonyexpanded.17.desc:0 "[Root.GetName]的挖掘从一开始就受到地下动物的攻击。通过策略性地关闭隧道和坚定的决心，我们能够在足够长的时间内击退他们，挖掘出预期的区域。然而，很明显，在它们造成更多伤害之前，必须加以处理。"
## colonyexpanded.17.desc -> The excavation on [Root.GetName] was hounded from the start by attacks by aggressive underground animals. Through strategic closing of tunnels and sheer determination, we were able to beat them back for long enough to excavate the intended area. It is clear, however, that they need to be dealt with before they cause more harm. ##
colonyexpanded.17.a:0 "看到它了。"
## colonyexpanded.17.a -> See it done. ##
colonyexpanded.18.name:0 "灾难"

colonyexpanded.21.name:0 "地下工程"
## colonyexpanded.21.name -> Subterranean Engineering ##
colonyexpanded.21.desc:0 "一组来自[Root.GetName]的工程师被允许进入地下，生活在那里的地下文明中，并在经过广泛研究后于最近返回。当地人已经开发了高度复杂的采矿设备，我们的工程师也学到了很多可以应用于我们自己的工业研究的东西。"
## colonyexpanded.21.desc -> A team of engineers from [Root.GetName] was allowed underground among the subterranean civilization that lives there, and have recently returned after extensive study. The natives have developed highly sophisticated mining equipment, and our engineers have learned much that could be applied to our own industrial research. ##
colonyexpanded.22.name:0 "地下工程"
## colonyexpanded.22.name -> Subterranean Engineering ##

## colonyexpanded.101.name -> Genetically Engineered Drones ##
colonyexpanded.101.desc: "[citadel_system.GetName]星系中的栖息地并不像最初扫描所显示的那样无人居住。这个车站是由一种奇怪的昆虫物种精心维护的。它们对任何交流的尝试都没有反应，任何侵入性的研究或干扰它们工作的尝试都会导致个体“自我毁灭”，迅速融化成一种蛋白质粘稠物。只要他们被单独留下，他们似乎就会满足于无视我们，在可怕的寂静中继续他们的工作。我们的科学家相信，它们是基因工程单位，由空间站的原始所有者制造，用于操控外星人的机器。"
## colonyexpanded.101.desc -> The habitat in the [citadel_system.GetName] system was not as uninhabited as initial scans led us to believe. The station is meticulously maintained by a strange insectoid species. They do not respond to any attempts to communicate, and any invasive attempt to study or interfere with their work results in the individual 'self-destructing,' quickly melting into a protein goo. As long as they are left alone, they seem content to ignore us and continue their work in eerie silence. Our scientists believe that they are genetically engineered drones, created to work the alien machinery by the station's original owners. ##
colonyexpanded.120.desc:0 "§H[Root.GetName]§!是生活在星球土壤深处的大型蠕虫的家园。它们非常好斗，对任何进入它们领土的东西都要捕食。它们经过的隧道富含不寻常的矿物质，这被认为是蠕虫分泌物与土壤反应的结果。进一步的分析显示,这些矿物质注入稀有资源§H泽洛§!。使用正确的技术,我们可以从这里的土壤中提取§H泽洛§!，假设我们在这个过程中没有打扰到本地的蠕虫。"
## colonyexpanded.120.desc -> §H[Root.GetName]§! is home to massive worms living deep in the planet's soil. They are highly aggressive, preying on anything that enters their territory. The tunnels they leave in their passing are rich in unusual minerals, believed to be the result of the worm's secretions reacting with the soil. Further analysis has revealed that these minerals are infused the rare resource §HZro§!. With the right technology, we can extract §HZro§! from the soil here, assuming we do not disturb the native worms in the process. ##
colonyexpanded.130.name:0 "大型文明遗迹"
## colonyexpanded.130.name -> Broken Enucumpenapolis ##
colonyexpanded.130.desc:0 "在 §H[Root.GetName]§ 的破碎的表面，尽管没有发现任何生物圈的活动的痕迹，但是很显然这颗行星被大量人造建筑覆盖，可能是一个巨大的废墟城市。有一些古老的活动痕迹，但尽管如此，我们还没有发现任何生物的残骸。而且这个星球上遍地都是大量的宝石。这些晶体并不是简单地随机分布，它们之前的主人故意放置在它们当前的位置。这些遗迹背后的到底有着怎么样故事？这一切还有待进一步研究。"
## colonyexpanded.130.desc -> Despite having no signs of ever supporting a biosphere, the entire surface of the broken world of §H[Root.GetName]§! is covered by a massive ruined city. The world shows signs of continued inhabitation for millennia, yet despite this, we have found no remains of its inhabitants.\n\nCuriously, the planet is littered with massive gemstones of all kinds. These crystals do not follow any known geological distribution, and therefore must have been deliberately placed in their current locations. Why someone would go to the effort of doing so is unknown. ##
colonyexpanded.130.a:0 "研究以前到底是什么样的智能生物居住在这?"
## colonyexpanded.130.a -> Find out who lived here. ##

## colonyexpanded.131.desc -> After recovering a data library from the ruins of §H[From.From.GetName]§!, Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName] has made a remarkable discovery. The crystal structures, originally thought to be inert minerals, are in fact the remains of the planet's original inhabitants. These silicate lifeforms dominated this section of the galaxy unopposed hundreds of millions of years ago, operating under a strict caste system based on gem type. The most recent records available show their civilization in collapse from rebellion and civil war.\n\nThese revelations have raised conserns about potential mining operations on §H[From.From.GetName]§!. While rare crystals are immensely valuable, these crystals are the remains of a unique lifeform, and some feel that their corpses should be respected. ##
colonyexpanded.131.a:0 "应该进一步研究这个世界。"
## colonyexpanded.131.a -> This world should be studied further. ##
colonyexpanded.131.b:0 "稀有的水晶!? 别废话了，马上开采。"

## colonyexpanded.507.desc -> Our researchers have concluded an extensive study on the Warp beasts specimen provided from the mirror universe. The creature is terrifying to look at, seemingly composed of nothing but teeth and claws, and ravenously devours any matter that gets too close to any of its many mouth parts. As described in field reports from the mirror universe, the Warp beast's hide forms a natural armor that is highly resistant to weapon damage, and its mouths produce a highly acidic saliva that it uses as a potent weapon.\n\nA major breakthrough was made when the beast was moved to one of our secure facilities for a sensitive experiment. After passing through the dimensional portal, it soon became less aggressive, acting with confusion and mild irritation at its new environment. Our researchers speculate that since we use hyperdrives, our universe lacks the characteristic warp signatures that woke the beasts in the mirror universe. Once we uncovered the biological mechanisms responsible for detecting subspace signatures, we were able to construct a device capable of distrupting these sensory organs, rendering the beasts temporarily disoriented. Used tactically, such a device could be devastating against Warp beast fleets. The only limitation is the massive power requirements, meaning it can only be equiped on large ships.\n\nOur counterparts in the mirror universe are delighted with our results, and have already begun constructing specially-designed ships for deployment against the Warp beasts. ##
