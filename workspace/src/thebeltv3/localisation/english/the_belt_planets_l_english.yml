  the_belt_building_asteroid_life_support_system:0 "Life-support system"
  the_belt_building_asteroid_life_support_system_desc:0 "Environmental control and life-support systems designed to supply air, water and food, adjust correct temperature and pressure as well as deal with waste recycling. It also provides shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites."
  asteroid_environment:0 "Asteroid"
  asteroid_environment_desc:0 "Asteroids or planetoids for the larger ones, are celestial objects made of rocks, iron, ice and precious metals. Remnants of planets formation, their exploitation is economically interesting as they can contain metals in quantity tenfold that of habitable planets in a much easier extractable form. Their low gravity also make them well suited for space construction."
  independent_belt_mining:0 "Mining Operations Hub"
  independent_belt_mining_desc:0 "Due to the rich market opportunities of asteroid mining many small independent operations have sprung up and are using this asteroid for refining, making it a local economic hub."
  stony_metal_asteroids_focus:0 "Metallic Asteroids Exploitation"
  stony_metal_asteroids_focus_desc:0 "S-type and M-type asteroids contain little to no water but more than ten times the amount of metal of carbonaceous types. They also often contain huge amount of rare metals critical for the industry."
  carbonaceous_asteroids_focus:0 "C-type Asteroid Exploitation"
  carbonaceous_asteroids_focus_desc:0 "Carbonaceous asteroids type have a lots of water, and carbon compounds useful for growing food (including phosphorus, "life's bottleneck"). Some assay at about 10% water, 10% reduced metal, and 5% metal sulphides. They are mostly water-bearing clay materials and magnetite stuck together with organic polymers."
  orbital_guard:0 "Orbit Guard"
  orbital_guard_desc:0 "The Orbit Guard keeps a close watch on all asteroids in the home system. If one starts to move without a permit, or if one with a permit strays off the filed flight plan, special military spacecraft are authorized to blow it out of the sky preemptively. Those ships are not part of our armed forces and only dedicated to the defense against asteroids."

  pc_barren_cold_tile:0 "Cold rocky ground"
  pc_barren_cold_tile_desc:0 "Rocky world covered in a thick layer of permanently frozen ice. Low temperatures and a very thin atmosphere precludes the existence of life on the surface."
